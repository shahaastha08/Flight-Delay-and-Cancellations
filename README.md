# Flight-Delay-and-Cancellations
A Tableau Dashboard to get insights from the 2015 Flight Dataset in the US

## Introduction

In this Dashboard, I present an in-depth analysis of flight delays and cancellations, utilizing the powerful data visualization software, Tableau. By leveraging Tableau's robust capabilities, I have transformed raw data into a visually appealing and interactive dashboard, enabling us to unravel intricate patterns, trends, and insights within the vast realm of flight-related information. This dashboard serves as a visual journey, showcasing my skills in data exploration, visualization design, and storytelling, as well as my ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data. 

This dataset consists of 2015 flight delays and cancellations and information on the various reasons for the delay like weather related delay, airline delay, departure delay, in-flight delay,and so on. In 2015 there are lots of flight delays in the United States. Nearly one third of all flights in our data set have delays.

This Tableau Dashboard provides a summary of the data, and provides insights into the reasons and patterns observed in delayed and canceled flights.
